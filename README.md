# Tic-Tac-Toe-1.0

The tic-tac-toe project is a web-based game developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is deployed on GitHub Pages, allowing users to access and play the game online. The project offers two distinct modes: a two-player game mode and a single-player mode, where the player competes against an unbeatable bot.

# Two Modes

1. **Single-Player Mode** - The single-player mode introduces a challenging aspect to the game by incorporating an unbeatable bot as the opponent. This mode fascinates players who test their skills against a formidable opponent. The JavaScript logic behind the bot's decision-making process is implemented using algorithms such as the minimax algorithm, allowing the bot to analyze and select the optimal moves to win or force a draw.
2. **Double Player Mode** - Any two players can compete in this mode.

The tic-tac-toe project showcases the combined power of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive and engaging gaming experience. It serves as a demonstration of front-end web development.
